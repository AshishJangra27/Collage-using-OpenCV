This project is specifically used to build collage with thousand of images in seconds with OpenCV. You can see the sample Images which i have build in 720p, 1080p, 2k,3k 4k and even 5K

Save all your images to the directory named as 'img_align_celeba' and the execute collage.ipynb file. You'll see a funciton called as make, Make fuciton takes 4 perameters. 

You can see the sample images which I've build using this program.
